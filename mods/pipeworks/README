This simple mod uses nodeboxes to supply a complete set of 3D flanged pipes, 
along with "valve" and "pump" devices.

Unlike the previous version of this mod, these pipes are rounded, and when 
placed, they'll automatically join together as needed.  Pipes can go vertically 
or horizontally, and there are enough nodes defined to allow for all possible 
connections.  Valves and pumps can only be placed horizontally, and will 
automatically rotate and join with neighboring pipes as objects are added, as 
well as joining with each other under certain circumstances.

Pipes come in two variants: one type bears one or more dark windows on each 
pipe, suggesting they're empty, while the other type bears green-tinted 
windows, as if full (the two colors should also be easy to select if you want 
to change them in a paint program).  These windows only appear on straight 
lengths and on certain junctions.

There are no crafting recipes, yet, but you can use /giveme as usual, namely 
"/giveme pipeworks:pipe 999" or so, and then place them as needed.  See 
init.lua for more details.

This mod is intended to be used as a basis or at least as sort of a model for 
something else to build on (perhaps a nicer-looking oil mod?), and does not 
provide any of the code necessary to cause anything to flow through them.  Like 
the pipes, the valve and pump don't do anything useful yet, but you can punch 
them to turn them "on" and "off".  Note that the valve and pump textures and 
shapes are not yet complete (hence their boxy appearance).

This mod is a work in progress.

Please note that owing to the nature of this mod, I have opted to use 64px 
textures.  Anything less just looks terrible.

If you don't need the old node names from the previous version of this mod, 
edit init.lua and comment-out the 'dofile' line at the top.
